# Playlist Editor for Spotify
Organize your Spotify playlists on your android device

## Overview
It is currently not possible to manually reorder playlist songs on the android Spotify app.  ([See here](https://community.spotify.com/t5/Live-Ideas/Rearrange-tracks-inside-a-playlist-Android/idi-p/690366).)  This app allows a user to log into their Spotify account and edit their playlists.  It was built using the [Ionic v1 framework](https://ionicframework.com/docs/v1/getting-started/).

## Source code
Source code for the app is located in the src folder.  I used babel to transpile that ES6 Javascript to ES5.  The ES5 code is located in www/js.

## Google Play
View it on the Google Play store [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ionicframework.spotifyplaylistmanager151406)!
